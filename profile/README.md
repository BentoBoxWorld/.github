### History

[tastybento](https://github.com/tastybento) created ASkyBlock and AcidIsland that shared the same codebase. These plugins became very popular but became hard to maintain.
[Poslovitch](https://github.com/Poslovitch) was running a Skyblock server before starting to contribute regularly to ASkyBlock's codebase. He proposed the idea of completely rewriting ASkyBlock
to make it easier to maintain and richer in features. In May 2017, this became the *BSkyBlock* project. As development progressed it became clear that a lot of the new core features could be used by other
island-style games and so that core functionality was split off and renamed *BentoBox* and the addon system was created. The addons for BSkyBlock and AcidIsland became very simple to develop and much smaller. In December 2019, Poslovitch launched the BentoBox collection on SpigotMC and the story continues! 
The community continues to grow and we added new game modes like SkyGrid and CaveBlock by BONNe. BONNe also took over maintenance of Challenges and Biomes and contributes to other addons.  
tastybento added more game modes, including AOneBlock, Boxed, Parkor, and Poseidon. BentoBox also moved from Spigot to focus on Paper API compatibility in 2025.
