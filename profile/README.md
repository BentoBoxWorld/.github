## Hi there üëã

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is BentoBox World about?

BentoBox World is where we develop BentoBox. BentoBox is a plugin for Minecraft servers running the Bukkit API, like Spigot, and Paper
with a unique addon system that enables it to be customized and configured how an admin likes. 
BentoBox focuses on island-based games like SkyBlock, OneBlock, AcidIsland, Boxed, SkyGrid, etc., and a whole suite of addons for
those games. You can download BentoBox and associated addons at [download.bentobox.world](https://download.bentobox.world).

### Who would use BentoBox? How?

BentoBox is for admins who want to run games like Skyblock, Oneblock or other island games on a Minecraft multiplayer server. BentoBox is a plugin for the server, i.e. some extra code that adds to the vanilla server code. If you want to find out about how to run your own Minecraft server for fun or profit, there are a lot of tutorials and videos on the Internet. Just google for it. Oracle provide a good blog on how to set up a free server on their cloud and there are many, many server hosting options out there. Bentobox enhances the  stock Minecraft game (also called vanilla) with new game modes that challenge new and experienced players alike. We hope you enjoy the "art" we have created and have fun with it!

### üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

BentoBox is supported by volunteers who code and test it. The best way for you to get involved is to clone the repos you are interested in, 
submit a PR, which might be Java code, or language translations, or config edits and that will start the ball rolling. We are always happy for
submissions. We also appreciate testers, who report bugs and recommend improvements. If you can't code, but want to support the work we do,
you can help by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tastybento), which helps pay for servers, domain names, and other costs.

If you contribute code it **must be in agreement** with:
* our [license](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox/blob/develop/LICENSE)
* our [code of conduct](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* our contribution guidelines

### History

[tastybento](https://github.com/tastybento) created ASkyBlock and AcidIsland that shared the same codebase. These plugins became very popular but became hard to maintain.
[Poslovitch](https://github.com/Poslovitch) was running a Skyblock server before starting to contribute regularly to ASkyBlock's codebase. He proposed the idea of completely rewriting ASkyBlock
to make it easier to maintain and richer in features. In May 2017, this became the *BSkyBlock* project. As development progressed it became clear that a lot of the new core features could be used by other
island-style games and so that core functionality was split off and renamed *BentoBox* and the addon system was created. The addons for BSkyBlock and AcidIsland became very simple to develop and much smaller. 
The community started to grow and we added new game modes like SkyGrid and CaveBlock by BONNe. BONNe also took over maintenance of Challenges and Biomes and contributed to other addons.  

In December 2019, Poslovitch launched the BentoBox collection on SpigotMC and the story continues!
